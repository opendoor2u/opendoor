Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Opendoor Core

 .
 This package provides the daemon, opendoord, and the CLI tool
 opendoor-cli to interact with the daemon.

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Opendoor Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
